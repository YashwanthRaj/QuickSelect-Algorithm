# Quickselect-Algorithm
CSCI 6212 [Project 2] - Median of Medians version of QuickSelect algorithm to find the kth smallest element in an array. 

Traditional way is to sort the array and find the kth element, but even the best sorting algorithm will give us a time complexity of O(nlog(n))
Instead we use QuickSelect Algorithm, which takes time complexity of O(n).
